Goal for today:
  Setup repository for project Plague and work with Tracy to plan out the layout of how the game will work, look and split up the work.
  Research why gamers are a fan of the game Plague, points of the game that will have to remain the same so that the game will not lose its initial function and attractiveness. 
  
  Progress:
    Planned out how the game may look when launched: start screen, main screen
    Planned out the main necessities of the game (look at obstacles...)

    Obstacles faced: One of the main attractions of the game Plague is that it is a very strategy based game, the spreading of the virus 
    can be impacted by a lot of things: climate, region, transmission....So, it will be difficult for us to replicate everything in the 
    game, will need to decide what we can do and what we cannot. Also, the story line of Plague is infecting the entire world, however 
    the entire world may be too large of a scale for us, so right now might begin with just the United States or the continent of North 
    America.

  Will Need For Tomorrow:
    Create game repository!

Goals for today:
  Setup repository
  Planout layout and features of game

  Progress:
    Created repository but need the GUI and etc. 
    Planned out initial layout of game: 
    
      Will be based on the United States
      
      Each state will be an instance of a class
        Will have vars: name, climate, population
        
      Display of the map will change with the change in population infected: 
        The more the population is infected the more red the map becomes
        When everyone in state dead map becomes black
        
      Will have a stats bar on the bottom of screen:
        OnHover of a state show: state name, population infected, population dead
        
      Will have a Disease menu and a cure menu
        In Disease menu: more on transmission, bacteria evolution, bacteria abilities
        
        In Cure menu: more on status of cure and stats....
     
     New members to our group
     Started coding some classes
     
   Need to Do:
   
     Plan out all the classes that are needed
     
     Plan out display of map (not sure how we will display the map as pieces of states put together or just use rectangles...)
     Distribution of work
