Goal for today:
  Setup repository for project Plague and work with Tracy to plan out the layout of how the game will work, look and split up the work.
  Research why gamers are a fan of the game Plague, points of the game that will have to remain the same so that the game will not lose its initial function and attractiveness. 
  
  Progress:
    Planned out how the game may look when launched: start screen, main screen
    Planned out the main necessities of the game (look at obstacles...)

    Obstacles faced: One of the main attractions of the game Plague is that it is a very strategy based game, the spreading of the virus 
    can be impacted by a lot of things: climate, region, transmission....So, it will be difficult for us to replicate everything in the 
    game, will need to decide what we can do and what we cannot. Also, the story line of Plague is infecting the entire world, however the 
    entire world may be too large of a scale for us, so right now might begin with just the United States or the continent of North 
    America.

  Will Need For Tomorrow:
    Create game repository!
